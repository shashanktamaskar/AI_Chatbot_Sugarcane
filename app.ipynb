      "Modern cars are equipped with numerous microprocessors that control various functions, including interior lighting, and these systems are far more complex than older vehicles. This complexity means that identifying the source of an electrical problem, such as a loss of power to the lights, can be challenging and time-consuming, even for experienced technicians using diagnostic tools.\n",
